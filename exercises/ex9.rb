# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun" #sets a variable for Days
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug" #sets a variable for Months but inserts new lines after every value.

puts "Here are the days: #{days}" #print the days
puts "Here are the months: #{months}" #print the months

# I can't actually comment in that quote thing, which makes sense.

    We'll be able to type as much as we like.
    Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
